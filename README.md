# InventoryApp

Inventory App for Udacity's data storage course in "Android Basics" series.

Designed and created the structure of an Inventory App which allows a book store to keep track of its inventory (books):
- designed and implemented the backend database (SQLite) that stores information about the books and suppliers
- UI for users to add and remove books, review details about particular book and see all available books in stock.

# Style and theme

Blue color palette with pink extras. Credit for images/icons: https://material.io/tools/icons/.
